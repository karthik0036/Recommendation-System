Movie Recoomendation Sys(Content Based)

A recommendation engine, also known as a recommender system, 
is software that analyzes available data to make suggestions for something that a user might be interested in.

There are basically four or three types of recommendation engines depending on who you ask:
1.Content based recommendation engine
2.Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine
3.Popularity based recommendation engine
4.Hybrid recommendation engine

The engine we will use is called a content based recommendation engine and it is 
a recommendation system that takes in a movie that a user likes 
and then analyzes it to get the movies content (e.g. genre, cast, director, keywords, etc.), 
it then ranks the recommended movies based on how similar the recommended movies 
are to the liked movie using something called similarity scores
